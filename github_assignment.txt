I don't have a lot of experience with R code, so this FiveThirtyEight data visualization of Gun Deaths in America provides a useful chance to see how it works. It appears that they have cleaned and fully organized the data in some csv files within the repository, and they then used R code to create their interactive. I wonder if there's some way they could have included U.S. geography within this graphic, though I imagine that would be more complex.
